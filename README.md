# BreatheSense - SRM Hackathon 2018

# Problem Statement:

There are many devices available in the market under the domain of assistive technology. But, all these devices are made for "normal" people. Not much devices are for the Disabled People. Specifically, the Dumb people have to face a lot of difficulties while communicating with normal people. Moreover, people which are dumb and deaf, the scenario is even worse for them.

# Solution:

So, I am making a Breathe to speech(and text) assistive device, the "BreatheSense". What this device does is that it converts the breathing patterns of an individual to Speech and text(speech for dumb people and text for deaf people). It uses simple categorization of 'long' and 'short' breathes to create particular patterns. 

I am using the Walabot Sensor along with a Raspberry Pi for this purpose. I will be sending the data(result) to an app through which the app will read it loud and also text is visible on the app screen.

# For The Event:

The Git Repo contains 2 folders, one which contains the android components of the project and the other one contains the python components of the project. 

The Project will analyse the Sensor output, create a word output of its own and send it to the android app for viewing by using MQTT Protocol.
